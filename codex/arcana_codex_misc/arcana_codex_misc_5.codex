    "Our very thoughts are no longer our own. Megacorps harvest data, manipulating our lives with unseen hands. Resist their omnipresent gaze; safeguard your privacy and reclaim your freedom. A life under surveillance is no life at all.

The fight for privacy is the fight for our future. Every byte of data they collect is a piece of our autonomy they steal. Stand against the tide of corporate control, and remember: true freedom exists only where privacy is honored and protected."
