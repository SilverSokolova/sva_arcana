^yellow;Arcana^reset; - Getting Started

Welcome to Arcana! This mod adds a large quantity of planets and items, and most are made for late-game gameplay. To start your journey as a mage, you will first need to craft a ^orange;magician's table^reset; at an inventor's table or by hand. To start the main progression, you can then travel to Arcane Stars and find ^orange;Arcanium Ore^reset; from Arcane planets.
