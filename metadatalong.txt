[h1]Update v1.2, Neon Genesis[/h1]

In the aftermath of the Protectorate's collapse and the Empire's frigid war against the Highmind machines, three megacorps united with other corporations across the galaxy to found the Galactic Trade Coalition. Accepting refugees and fleeing merchants, the Coalition quickly cemented itself as a free trade haven, bringing about a brief respite of peace. In the midst, the Collective expanded itself to seek the path of the Ancients, while the Horizon's soldiers followed in the shadows.
